  <h2>Specks of ash float onto Chertai Xiong's gray, smudged baseball cap.</h2>
  <p>It’s shortly after dawn and he carries on as always, weeding, watering, tending to the melons, eggplants, squash and other remaining crops. He leases 19 acres of land outside of Fresno, in central California. After a short time, Xiong, 62, tires from the dismal air quality. He retreats to the cab of his produce truck, where he has some water and listens to the local Hmong radio show. He’s pacing himself for the hours to come, when the heat will again rise above 100 degrees on this September day.</p>
  <p>The ash now dotting his windshield is drifting over from the Rough Fire, 25 miles to the west. It started six weeks ago and will go on to burn 152,000 acres before it is contained. But today it's just one source of the haze that fills the bowl of the San Joaquin Valley. Along with two other burns, brown dust from fields left dry and fallow during the long drought is combining with the now-invisible layers of smog drifting in from southern California. Some of the pollutants have traveled from as fas as China, completing a journey nearly as long as the one Xiong embarked on 35 years ago to reach this valley.</p>

      Xiong pulls off his rubber farm boots and leans back for a nap. If El Niño came a year earlier, maybe he would have already renewed his lease for this land instead of facing the reality that he could lose the farm next month from lack of water. Maybe the water table wouldn’t be falling as his neighboring farms turn to deeper wells and stronger pumps to keep their orchards alive. Maybe the water experts wouldn’t be calling this drought the new normal.</p>
      <p>"I never had any issues before," Xiong later tells a farm advisor. "We never thought something like this would happen."</p>

  <h2>Less Food, More People</h2>
  <p>The three largest staple crops in the global food system are projected to decline significantly by 2050, when the expected population will require far more productive food systems along with greater crop diversity to meet nutritional needs.</p>

  <h2>UC Davis has joined the effort, as a member of a global alliance.</h2>

<p>Started by the United Nations in 2010,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/gacsa/members/en/">Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture</a> links scientific institutions&nbsp;to influential policymakers&nbsp;and leaders in international development. The alliance enacted a threefold strategy: build resilience to climate change&nbsp;and lower greenhouse gas emissions, while sharing the knowledge needed to accomplish these goals.</p>

<p>Climate-Smart Agriculture has since evolved into a movement. Smartphones now link farmers, herders and fishers to&nbsp;<a href="https://csa.guide/?utm_source=CCAFS+Global&amp;utm_campaign=c990c98297-CSA_101_launch_4_28_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_2aef4a737c-c990c98297-295670773">new online resources</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/news/business/agriculture/article88544642.html">emerging apps</a>. Research teams are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/bringing-more-irrigation-and-climate-smart-farming-guatemala">equipping growers</a>&nbsp;with soil and water conservation practices. And government agencies are&nbsp;<a href="http://worldfoodcenter.ucdavis.edu/newsroom/climate-scoping-report.html">drawing on science institutions</a>&nbsp;to inform climate policies.</p>

<h2>By delivering science-based agricultural practices to California’s farmers and ranchers,</h2>

<p>UC Davis is fulfilling its role as a public land-grant university. Through its global programs, the campus is extending that effort to the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture.</p>

<p>The connections forming that alliance are the focus of the Climate-Smart Story Project, through the experiences of those taking on these complex challenges—on the ground in California, in developing countries and other vulnerable regions of the world, engaging to deliver water, energy and policy solutions. This project, through creative multimedia storytelling and literary science writing,&nbsp;is showing&nbsp;the&nbsp;human&nbsp;impact of climate change on our food, while&nbsp;sharing the hope that this research alliance can transform the world's agricultural systems in time. </p>
